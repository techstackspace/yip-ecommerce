# YIP E-Commerce Case Study

This is a **basic Laravel e-commerce site** built for the PHP Full Stack Developer role at **YipOnline**. The application includes product listing, shopping cart, checkout flow, user authentication, admin order management, and responsive design principles. While Smarty is not yet integrated, the structure follows modular and clean Laravel standards to allow for future integration.

* Authenticated users can:

  * Add products to cart
