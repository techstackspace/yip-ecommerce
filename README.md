# YIP E-Commerce Case Study

This is a **basic Laravel e-commerce site** built for the PHP Full Stack Developer role at **YipOnline**. The application includes product listing, shopping cart, checkout flow, user authentication, admin order management, and responsive design principles. While Smarty is not yet integrated, the structure follows modular and clean Laravel standards to allow for future integration.

* **Register/Login/Logout** (via Laravel Breeze)
* Authenticated users can:

  * Add products to cart
  * Checkout and place orders

* Checkout only when logged in
* Cart resets after successful order

### Product Management

* View all orders from all users
* Each order shows:

  * Products and quantities

### Responsive Design
